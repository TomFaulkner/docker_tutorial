#+title: Notes
* Steps
1. Setup a flask app w/ venv
2. See that it works
3. Write a dockerfile
4. Run it, and see that the thing is running but not accessible
5. docker ps
6. Add exposed ports and flask config
7. Compose
8. Compose env variables
9. Why docker?
   1. Same os environment on local and prod
   2. Runs on anything
   3. Ephemeral
   4. No dependency hell
   5. Repeatable builds
   6. Separation from the host means OS updates don't break things
   7. Security: ACE probably doesn't get to the host OS or other containers
   8. Simplicity: can download and run with the exact same environment with a single command
   9. Scalability: I can run X instances by adding a single line to a config file w/ swarm, kubes, aws, etc.
